# Task: Project Setup and QuickBooks OAuth Integration

## Context
We're building an AI-powered accounting application that initially integrates with QuickBooks Online and uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with Claude for intelligent features. Based on our integration report, we've identified the Financial Insights MVP project as having a reusable QuickBooks OAuth implementation that would accelerate our development.

## Objective
Set up the initial project structure and implement the QuickBooks OAuth flow based on the components from the Financial Insights MVP project.

## Tasks
1. Initialize the Git repository with proper configuration:
   - Create the main branch and development branch
   - Set up appropriate .gitignore file
   - Configure Git hooks for linting and testing
   - Make initial commit with base project structure

2. Set up the development environment:
   - Configure Node.js/TypeScript environment
   - Install necessary dependencies
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Configure Jest testing framework

3. Implement the QuickBooks OAuth flow:
   - Adapt the OAuth implementation from Financial Insights MVP
   - Create secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Set up configuration for development and production environments

4. Create basic database models:
   - Design schema for users and authentication
   - Create models for QuickBooks connection data
   - Implement migrations for initial database setup
   - Add seed data for testing

5. Develop simple API endpoints:
   - Create endpoint for initiating OAuth flow
   - Implement callback handling
   - Add endpoint for testing connection status
   - Create documentation for the OAuth API

## Deliverables
1. Fully configured Git repository with initial project structure
2. Working QuickBooks OAuth flow with secure token management
3. Database migrations and models for user and connection data
4. API endpoints for OAuth process
5. Basic documentation for the OAuth implementation

## Technical Requirements
- Use Node.js with TypeScript
- Use PostgreSQL for database
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement proper security measures for token storage
- Include error handling and logging

## Resources
- Integration Report with assessment of potential source projects
- Financial Insights MVP project for OAuth implementation reference
- QuickBooks API documentation (https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop)
- Model Context Protocol specification for future AI integration
```
