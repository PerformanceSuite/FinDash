## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered accounting application that initially integrates with QuickBooks Online (QBO) and eventually becomes a standalone platform. The goal is to harness Claude and other AI models through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide intelligent bookkeeping automation, financial insights, and advisory capabilities, addressing key pain points for accounting firms and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs).

The platform will initially leverage QuickBooks as a system of record while adding AI-driven capabilities, with a gradual transition to a full-fledged accounting solution. The target users are accounting firms (who can resell to their clients) and SMBs looking for more intelligent, automated accounting solutions.

## System Architecture

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The application will leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate AI models with accounting data. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Secure Data Access**: MCP allows Claude to access accounting data without exposing sensitive information.
2. **Controlled AI Operations**: Provides a structured way for the AI model to perform specific accounting tasks.
3. **Flexibility**: Enables switching between AI providers while maintaining the same integration pattern.
4. **Standardized Communication**: Establishes a consistent way for the accounting app to interact with AI models.

  // Fetch relevant financial data
  const accounts = fetchAccounts(userId);
  const transactions = fetchTransactions(userId, dateRange);
  const metrics = calculateKeyMetrics(userId, dateRange);
  
  // Format for Claude consumption via MCP
  return {
    financialContext: {
      accounts,
      recentTransactions: transactions.slice(0, 50),
      keyMetrics: metrics,
      dateRange
    },
    userQuery: query
